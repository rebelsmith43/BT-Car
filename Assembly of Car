Attach Arduino to chassis
Attach Arduino motor shield to Arduino
Attach breadboard to chassis
The top platform of the vehicle comes with a lot of slots where things can be attached. To mount the Arduino board there I attached three standoffs with screws from underneath. I kept them a bit loose until I found the right positions that matched the mounting holes in the board. Unfortunately I could not find a combination of slots that allowed me to match all four mounting holes, so three had to do:
 
The board ended up a tiny bit crooked with respect to the platform, but other than that it was pretty solid:
 
I then needed to mount the breadboard in the front of the vehicle. The bottom of the breadboard has adhesive, but since I wasn't sure everything would work fine with this configuration I decided to simply attach it with a rubberband and keep the option to undo the whole thing without complications:
 
Next carefully line up the pins on the motor shield with the Aduino pins and plug it in
Arduino Bluetooth Receiver
Plug Arduino Bluetooth Receiver into breadboard
Run line from 5V pin on Arduino motor shield to breadboard 
Connect VCC to voltage line on breadboard
Run line from GND pin on Arduino motor shield to breadboard 
Connect GND to GND line on breadboard
Connect TXD to pin 0 on Arduino motor shield
Connect RXD to pin 1 on Arduino motor shield

HC-SR04 Proximity Sensor
Plug HC-SR04 proximity sensor into breadboard facing forward* as far forward as possible
Connect VCC to voltage line on breaboard
Connect Trig to pin 7 on Arduino motor shield
Connect Echo to pin 10 on Arduino motor shield 
Connect GND to GND line on breadboard
LM393 Sound Detector
Connect +5V to voltage line on breadboard
Connect OUT to pin 5 on Arduino motor shield 
Connect GND to GND line on breadboard
DC Motors 
Connect red line of right DC motor to + pin on A side of blue block on Arduino motor shield
Connect black line of right DC motor to – pin on A side of blue block on Arduino motor shield
Right motor will need line extended with breadboard and extra lines to blue block
Connect red line of left DC motor to + pin on B side of blue block on Arduino motor shield
Connect black line of left DC motor to – pin on B side of blue block on Arduino motor shield
